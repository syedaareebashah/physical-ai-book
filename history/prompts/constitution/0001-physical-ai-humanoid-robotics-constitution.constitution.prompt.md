# Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Prompt Text

Create constitution for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book:

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Match ai-native.panaversity.org aesthetic exactly
- Modern, clean, professional design with gradients
- Fully responsive mobile-first approach
- Dark mode as default with light mode toggle
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)

HOMEPAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Hero section with gradient background (purple/blue theme)
- Book cover image prominently displayed
- Clear value proposition
- Feature cards with icons
- Maturity levels section
- Traditional vs AI-Native comparison table
- Call-to-action buttons
- Footer with social links

CONTENT STRUCTURE:
- Built with Docusaurus v3 + TypeScript
- MDX for interactive content
- 4 main modules as separate sections
- Progressive learning: theory → practice → project
- Each chapter: objectives, content, exercises, summary
- Sidebar navigation with progress tracking

EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS:
- Beginner-friendly with technical depth
- Real-world analogies before technical details
- All code examples tested and runnable
- Visual learning with diagrams and videos
- Hands-on exercises after each concept

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Docusaurus 3.5+ with TypeScript
- React 18+ for custom components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Mermaid.js for diagrams
- Algolia DocSearch for search
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

DEPLOYMENT:
- GitHub Pages deployment
- Automatic builds on main branch push
- Preview deployments for PRs
- Custom domain support
- Performance optimized (Lighthouse > 90)

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- All links validated
- Mobile responsive testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- SEO optimized
- Fast loading times

## Response Text

Successfully updated the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook constitution, incrementing version from 7.0.0 to 8.0.0. Added new sections for Design Principles, Technical Stack, Deployment, and enhanced Quality Requirements. The constitution now includes all requested requirements while preserving existing educational principles. New sections cover design aesthetics, technical stack requirements (Docusaurus, TypeScript, React, Tailwind, Mermaid, Algolia), deployment specifications (GitHub Pages, automatic builds, preview deployments), and quality requirements (link validation, responsive testing, cross-browser compatibility).

## Outcome Impact

The constitution now comprehensively covers all aspects of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project, including design, technical implementation, deployment, and quality standards. This provides complete governance for the project moving forward.

## Tests Summary

none

## Files Summary

- C:\Users\admin\OneDrive\Desktop\AIDD-Hackathon\.specify\memory\constitution.md: Updated constitution with new sections and version 8.0.0

## Next Prompts

1. Update template files to align with new constitution principles
2. Create implementation plan for the technical stack requirements
3. Begin development of the Docusaurus-based documentation site

## Reflection Note

The constitution update successfully integrated all requested requirements while maintaining the existing educational focus. The version increment to 8.0.0 properly reflects the significant addition of technical and deployment requirements.

## Failure Modes Observed

No failure modes observed during implementation.

## Next Experiment to Improve Prompt Quality

Consider creating validation checks to ensure all constitution requirements are implemented in downstream artifacts.
