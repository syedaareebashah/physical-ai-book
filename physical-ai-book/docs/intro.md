# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional screen-based artificial intelligence to embodied intelligence systems that interact with the physical world. Unlike conventional AI that processes data in digital environments, Physical AI systems must understand and navigate real-world physics, spatial relationships, and dynamic environments.

Physical AI encompasses:
- **Embodied Intelligence**: AI systems with physical form and sensors
- **Real-World Interaction**: Direct manipulation and navigation of physical spaces
- **Sensor Fusion**: Integration of multiple sensory inputs (vision, touch, proprioception)
- **Spatial Reasoning**: Understanding 3D environments and object relationships
- **Physics Understanding**: Comprehension of forces, motion, and material properties

## Why Humanoid Robotics?

Humanoid robots represent the ultimate challenge in Physical AI because they must:
- Navigate human environments designed for bipedal locomotion
- Interact with tools and interfaces built for human use
- Understand human social cues and communication patterns
- Perform complex manipulation tasks with dexterous hands
- Adapt to unpredictable real-world scenarios

## Course Overview

This comprehensive curriculum spans 12-16 weeks and progresses through four core modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn to build the communication backbone that enables distributed robotic systems to coordinate complex behaviors.

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Master simulation environments that allow safe testing and development before deploying to real hardware.

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
Develop intelligent perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous decision-making.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Combine large language models with robotic systems for cognitive planning and natural interaction.

## Target Audience

This course is designed for:
- Students with AI/ML fundamentals
- Python programmers interested in robotics
- No prior ROS or robotics experience required
- Willingness to engage with complex, interdisciplinary concepts

## Learning Approach

Our pedagogy emphasizes:
1. **Real-world analogies** before technical details
2. **Progressive complexity** from theory to practice to projects
3. **Hands-on exercises** after each concept
4. **Visual learning** with diagrams and interactive elements
5. **Practical applications** with tested, runnable code examples

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:
- Proficiency in Python programming
- Basic understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of fundamental AI/ML concepts
