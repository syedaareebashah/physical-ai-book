- Basic understanding of sensors and actuators
- Introduction to control systems

## Setup Verification

### Python Environment Test
Run the following to verify your Python setup:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print("Python environment ready!")

# Test basic numpy operations
vector = np.array([1, 2, 3])
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(f"Vector: {vector}")
print(f"Matrix: {matrix}")
```

### System Requirements Check
